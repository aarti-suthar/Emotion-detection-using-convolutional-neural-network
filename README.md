# Emotion-detection-using-convolutional-neural-network
In this project,I have created a real-time emotion detection system.The dataset I have used consisits of 48x48 pixel grayscale faces. The task is to categorize each face based on the emotion shown in thr facial expression into one of five catgories(0=Angry,1=Happy,2=Sad,3=Surprise,4=Neutral).
